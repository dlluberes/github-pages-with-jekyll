A familiar question every software developer and team grapples with is, “How much testing is enough to qualify a software release?” A lot depends on the type of software, its purpose, and its target audience. One would expect a far more rigorous approach to testing commercial search engne than a simple smartphone flashlight application. Yet no matter what the application, the question of how much testing is sufficient can be hard to answer in definitive terms. A better approach is to provide considerations or rules of thumb that can be used to define a qualification process and testing strategy best suited for the case at hand. The following tips provide a helpful rubric:

    Document your process or strategy.
    Have a solid base of unit tests.
    Don’t skimp on integration testing.
    Perform end-to-end testing for Critical User Journeys.
    Understand and implement the other tiers of testing.
    Understand your coverage of code and functionality.
    Use feedback from the field to improve your process.

Document your process or strategy
If you are already testing your product, document the entire process. This is essential for being able to both repeat the test for a later release and to analyze it for further improvement. If this is your first release, it’s a good idea to have a written test plan or strategy. In fact, having a written test plan or strategy is something that should accompany any product design.
